some examples
    object detection
    vision
        optical flow, segmentation, image coloration,
        sounds to silent movies, depth from images
    generating music, text, solving theorems!
    weather prediction, fingerprint detection
    RNNs, reinforcement learning

linear regression and SVMs
    

general
    backprop
    first-order methods

architecture
    convolution
        picture of convolution
        why does it work so well? give example
    non-linerities
        sigmoids, why?
        ReLU
    regularization
        maxpool
        dropout
        batch-norm

hyper-parameter search
